# How to connect to this server using LogMeIn Hamachi

1. Download LogMeIn Hamachi using this link [here](https://vpn.net) and install the software onto your device. This software is a VPN service that emulates Local Area Networks (LAN) and allows software to create direct connections to other peers also connected to the emulated LAN without the need to have anybody port forward or tinker with their firewall settings.

2. Once installed, sign in on your device or create an account if you don't have one. The service is free and you can also log in through a web browser using [this link](https://secure.logmein.com/central/Central.aspx) to change anything you may need to and view your networks and connections.

3. Once logged in, press the power button in the top left of the GUI and after a few moments it should display your PC name and an IPV4 and IPv6 address.

4. Hit the `Join an existing network` button and put in the network name and password in the prompt. The network name and password are below.

- Network Name: `COPPER_ISLAND`
- Network Password: `WarwickPawJob`
- If a direct connection can be made then there should be a green circle next to where it says the network name. 

5. Next you will right click where it shows the IPV4/IPv6 addresses for the server and hit `Copy IPV4 address`. This is how you will connect to the server in Minecraft.

6. Open up minecraft and navigate to the `Multiplayer` tab. From there you will hit the `Direct Connection` button and paste in the address that you copied from Hamachi and press `Join Server`. If all goes well, then the tunnel that hamachi created for you will be used by your Minecraft client to connect directly to the server.
